The Python Script I have written is found the the PyCitySchools Folder.

Based on the analysis conducted on the school district data, we can draw the following conclusions:

Schools with smaller student populations tend to perform better academically than schools with larger student populations. This is evident from the fact that the average math and reading scores, as well as the percentage of students passing math and reading, were highest for small schools with fewer than 1000 students. In contrast, the average math and reading scores, as well as the percentage of students passing math and reading, were lowest for large schools with more than 2000 students.

Charter schools tend to perform better academically than district schools. This is evident from the fact that charter schools had higher average math and reading scores, as well as higher percentages of students passing math and reading, than district schools. Additionally, the overall passing rate for charter schools was higher than that for district schools.

These conclusions can help school districts make informed decisions about how to allocate resources and improve academic performance. For example, a school district might consider investing more resources in smaller schools or converting some of its district schools into charter schools to improve overall academic performance.
